        <p class="tribute-info" id="tribute-info">Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars
            of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of
            science. He is best known to the general public for his massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been
            dubbed "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical
            physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development
            of quantum theory.</p>
